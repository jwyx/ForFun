/*
 *  Question:
 *    "Reduce a given fraction to its lowest terms; Or find the greatest common divisor (gcd)
 *    of the numerator and the denominator: the largest integer which divides them both"
 *
 *  Solution:
 *    Euclid algorithm
 *    Based on the fact that:
 *      If u is greater than v then the greatest common divisor of u and v is the same as the
 *      greatest common divisor of v and u - v
